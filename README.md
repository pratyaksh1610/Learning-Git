# :dart: Learning Git
Git is a free and open source version control system which helps to keep track of our files by maintaining the history of the code repository. 

# :dart: How Git works ?

     1. Create a "repository" (project).

     2. Clone the repository to your local machine.

     3. Add a file to your local repo and "commit" (save) the changes.

     4. "Push" the changes to your main branch.

     5. Create a "branch" , make a change, commit the change.

     6. Open a "pull request" (propose changes to the main branch).

     7. "Merge" your branch to the main branch.
